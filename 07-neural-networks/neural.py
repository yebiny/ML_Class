# CODE HERE

# Example of a neural network. There is one hidden layer of two nodes,
# and an output layer. It computes the XNOR (NOT XOR) of the 2 inputs
xnor = [ [[10, -20, -20], [-30, 20, 20]], # hidden layer
         [[0, 1, 1]] # output layer
]
# Find a neural network that works as a XOR gate!
xor = [ ]
