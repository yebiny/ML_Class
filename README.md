# Class Overview
## 02 Gradient descent
## 03 Regression  
- Regression is one of the major tasks in machine learning
- Idea: given some pieces of data, can you predict some dependent variables
- Examples
  - Can you predict the sale price of a house given location, size,
    no. of rooms, etc.
  - Given response of a calorimeter (measured in ADC counts), can you
    find the energy of the incoming particle
- Often the question is not so much to predict a quantity, but ask if
  there's a correlation between variables
  - Ex: Does the number of years in school impact your future salary
  - More concretely: how much of the variance in salary is explained
    by years of education
- Much of the statistics in regression is to say how significant the
  correlation between the variables is
- We'll contain ourselves mostly to the question of prediction, in
  particular /parametric regression/
